       --- The slowest ext2 driver ever ---

This is a FUSE ext2 implementation in Python. It supports read-only 
mounting only:
    ### Mount
    $ ./e2fuse.py ext2.img mnt_dir 

    ### Umount:
    $ fusermount -u mnt_dir             # Linux
    $ umount mnt_dir                    # OS X

May be used for learning purposes, as a very simple and high-level 
ext2 implementation. Tested on Linux and OS X (fuse4x). 

Class ext2fs tries to provide user-friendly and abstract interface to 
filesystem manipulation routines:
    >>> from ext2 import *
    >>> fs = ext2fs('ext2.img')
    >>> fs.ls('/')
    >>> fs.free_space_bytes()

Also this is a collection of low-level classes for inspecting ext2
internals. In order to use it effectively you need understanding
the ext2 data layout. May be used  for manual manipulation with
an (possibly broken or nonstandard) ext2 filesystem.
