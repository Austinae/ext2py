       --- The slowest ext2 driver ever ---

This is a collection of low-level classes for inspecting ext2 
internals. In order to use it effectively you need understanding
the ext2 data layout. The main goal of this tool is to be a tool 
for manual manipulation on an ext2 filesystem (possibly broken or 
nonstandard).

Class ext2fs tries to provide user-friendly and abstract interface to 
filesystem manipulation routines.
