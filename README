       --- The slowest ext2 driver ever ---

This is a FUSE ext2 implementation in Python. Now it support read-only 
mounting only:
    $ ./e2fuse.py ext2.img mnt_dir 
Works on Linux and OS X (fuse4x).

Class ext2fs tries to provide user-friendly and abstract interface to 
filesystem manipulation routines:
    >>> from ext2 import *
    >>> fs = ext2fs('ext2.img')
    >>> fs.ls('/')
    >>> fs.free_space_bytes()

Also this is a collection of low-level classes for inspecting ext2
internals. In order to use it effectively you need understanding
the ext2 data layout. The main goal of this tool is to be a tool 
for manual manipulation on an ext2 filesystem (possibly broken or 
nonstandard).
